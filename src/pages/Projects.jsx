      <Text>The final project for term 1A consisted of a Robot that picks up a cube in a 1m X 1m
        area.
        The purpose of this project was to create a robot that solved a specific problem. The problem chosen
        was to collect objects that are scattered around in a set area. To do this, the robot will have to be able
        to find these objects and travel the appropriate distance to collect them with its collection mechanism, in
        this case a claw. The objects are also of different types, in this problem each object is a different colour.
        The robot must identify what colour the object is after it has collected it and transport it to a specific location
        corresponding to the colour of the object. The system used was an EV3 robot with modifications to the standard
        mechanical configuration.

        During the 2021 FRC Season I developed a Color Tracking program using an OpenMV Camera. However, this OpenMV is 
        modded to house a ring of LEDs for better object detection.
        It performs specific manipulations on the raw camera image to optimize the image for color tracking
        based on its environment. It then performs color tracking along with custom object detection code tailored to the required object.
        It then packages all the necessary information into JSON and sends it over UART. While this project
        deviates from the usual method of machine vision using OpenCV, it taught me to utilize a camera's raw capture to its full potential
        before using complex algorithms and machine learning.

        One of the largest individual projects I undertook. It required learning how to weld, and a significant amount
        of mechanical knowledge. Everything including designing the project, welding the frame, soldering the circuitry,
        was all from scratch. It took around eight months
        to complete and it is one of my proudest achievements. I was only able to build such a large project because I
        was a part of <a href="/#/roots2stem">Roots 2 Stem</a>.

        I noticed that I would often forget to water my multiple plants. In order to remedy this I designed an Automatic
        Plant Watering system. I began with an idea for a compact box that
        housed a Raspberry Pi or Arduino board that
        could control the rest
        of the system. I decided to house the potentiometers and the temperature sensor in the same box. I did this
        because they are small and lightweight so it would be simpler to add them. I decided to have 4 “modules”
        that
        each have a transmitter that sends a signal to the pumps to turn them on and off. There are 4 modules
        because
        there are only 4 potentiometers anymore and I would not be able to fit them onto the design.
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <Text>
        The final design enables the user to adjust exactly how much to water their plant every 10 days. The
        system
        automatically calculates how much to add or subtract water amount based on temperature and humidity. The
        criteria shaped it to be a small compact design that is easy to set up and use. The use of a Raspberry Pi
        makes
        it suitable to run for months on end. Multiple modules allow adding more plants easy, even while the system
        is
        still running. The connector design makes it difficult to install a module incorrectly. A smaller pump
        allows
        for more precise watering as well as the ability to place in almost any water tank. The cost to manufacture
        a
        single module and system is $125.87 making the device affordable. This price will decreases as more systems
        are
        manufactured as many of the parts needed can be bought in bulk. The Automatic plant watering system is
        perfect
        for any indoor plant, and is for anyone who might forget to water their plants.

        During the Covid-19 pandemic you had to continually sanitize and clean your hands. Especially when returning
        from a
        venture outside. While returning from these ventures you absolutely need to sanitize and wash your hands before
        you touch
        anything in your home to kill the pesky Coronavirus.
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <Text>
        The Hand Sanitiser solves the issue of
        contaminating your home before you properly wash or
        sanitize them, as can often happen while handling a bottle of hand sanitizer or turning the tap while washing
        your hands. The Hand Sanitizer is designed so that the user does
        not have to touch any surfaces to sanitize
        their hands. It is to be secured on the front door so that you or your family members while sanitizing their
        hands before touching the handle. It works based on an ultrasonic sensor that detects when something is
        close by
        then an Arduino sets off a servo that sprays the bottle that contains isopropyl alcohol. The bottle sprays a
        fine mist so that the droplets are spread out and you can effectively kill the coronavirus. The design has
        proved to be lightweight and small. The sensors are in prime position for the spray bottle to
        spray a person’s hands. The easy refill method makes it simple to use. This along with the easy setup of
        only
        having to plug it into an outlet makes for an "easy to use product" for anyone. It also has no fancy cables
        and
        only requires a USB connection to a power adapter. The accurate ultrasonic sensor along with changes
        in the code allows for great detection and minimal waste of isopropyl alcohol. The max amount of “sprays”
        the
        code will allow for a single detection is 4 as that is more than enough to sanitize your hands thoroughly as
        found by testing. It also detects if a person left before waiting for 4 sprays and automatically will stop.
        The
        spray bottle volume is 60ml so that is more than 414 “sprays” or if you use the Hand Sanitizer twice a day
        that
        is 52 days before needing a quick refill by removing the bottle and filling it with isopropyl alcohol. Most
        automatic sanitizer/soap dispensers online are around $50-$150, but my design costs only $32.04 to
        manufacture.

        I discovered my passion for Aerospace when I built my first Delta wing RC plane in <a href="/#/roots2stem">Roots 2 Stem</a>
        . I have made around 5 iterations of my initial Delta wing RC Plane, flying whenever I have free time. My most recent RC Plane
        deviates from the Delta wing design and is a top fixed wing amphibious plane. The wings are constructed with standard foamboard,
        while the fuselage is a 3D printed custom design.
