        For those with vision impairement or really anyone who wants to feel through pressure how far the ground is this is the product. 
        Our team was able to achieve a full prototype of our idea in just 36 hours! I am very proud of what we were able to accomplish with a few hgih torque servos and IR sensors.
        We even impressed the judges and won best hardware hack!

      <Text>
        At GoodLabs Studio in my role of Bipedal Robotics Engineering, I developed a PPO reinforcement learning model for a bipedal robot within NVIDIA's Isaac Gym.
        This took nearly 4 months of work and lots of learning from developing a simulation model of the robot to developing the RL algorithm, and testing various other methods
        within the field. Our codebase worked off an existing open source Isaac Gym legged robots codebase, and we had to modify it heavily to work for bipedal humanoid robots.
        With reward functions that encourages walking, including a custom gait reward function that I developed which follows an 8 stage human gait cycle.
        This led to natural walking for <a href="#/goodlabsrobotics">Robbie the robot</a>.

        At GoodLabs Studio in my role of Bipedal Robotics Engineering, I designed, built and developed a bipedal robot alongside <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/bchharawala">Brendan Chharawala</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-hemeon-119bb3269/">Ethan Hemeon</a>.
        The culmination of 4 months of work during my first co-op term resulted in a functional bipedal robot that could resist pushes and remain stable through the use of feedback control.
        I specifically designed the hip joints and knee joints, and developed the PID control system in C++ for the robot.
        In the co-op that followed I went on to develop a reinforcement learning algorithm, <a href="#/goodlabsrl">that has its own page</a>, which produced natural walking for this robot. In my third co-op term my team and I were able to achieve untethered walking with the robot through my implementation of RL alongside a specialized gait function. We also kept a {" "}

        competition, and this time our goal was to use computer vision
        techniques, particularly OpenCV, to detect a hole and verify if a black
        sticker was correctly placed over it. Working alongside Mahir Mohota, we
        leveraged precise object tracking capabilities offered by OpenCV, which
